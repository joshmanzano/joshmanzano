Hello there!

My name is Josh. I am a master's graduate in Computer Science and a former senior software engineer at Yahoo.

I've been lucky enough to have a successful computer science career so far, and I'd like to give back by offering free online tutoring in Computer Science (which includes coding/programming) and Math to anyone who might need help in these.

I have experience teaching as an online lecturer at De La Salle University, as well as extensive experience teaching my peers during my time at university.

If you or someone you know is interested, feel free to email me at [josh@manzano.dev](mailto:josh@manzano.dev) with the subject you'd like help with and your preferred times.

For those who don't use email often, you can also reach me through [*joshmanzano.com/contact*](https://joshmanzano.com/contact).
