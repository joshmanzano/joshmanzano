# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is `Josh`. 

I'm a master's graduate at [NTUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_University_of_Science_and_Technology) and a software engineer for [Yahoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yahoo/mycompany/) who likes to go [freediving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freediving) and [rock climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_climbing) in my free time. 

I enjoy educating people for free and creating accessible, ethical software that benefits people in need.
